# x86 kernels

The kernels implement the default design in `docs/research/x86_64-design.md`, section 5.
They contain no glibc source or disassembly.
`THIRD_PARTY.md` records the design references.

## Dispatch

A build without AVX2 selects these kernels at run time (`docs/runtime-dispatch.md`).
`level.zig` compiles them once per level, and `dispatch.zig` selects a level from CPUID.
A level object is instruction-identical to the comptime build for its CPU.

`memcpy` and `memmove` share the C kernel.
The inline copy path specializes the large dispatch for disjoint buffers.
Both paths retain the 4K alias test.
A source inside the destination range always uses the forward vector loop.
Every forward overlap bypasses REP, not only gaps below 64 bytes.

All vector memory operations use vector pointers.
The inline layer contains no loops.
Every non-inline kernel function disables intrinsic recognition.
LLVM emits `vzeroupper` after vector paths.

| Model | Vector bytes | REP copy minimum, exclusive | Copy NT minimum, inclusive | REP set minimum, exclusive | Set NT minimum, inclusive |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sapphirerapids | 64 | 16384 | 0x3580000 | 2048 | 0x3580000 |
| graniterapids | 64 | 16384 | 0xf100000 | 2048 | 0xf100000 |
| znver4 | 64 | none | 0xc00001 | none | none |
| znver5 | 64 | none | 0xc00001 | none | none |
| other AVX-512BW | 64 | none | none | none | none |
| x86_64_v3 | 32 | none | none | none | none |

The NT loops use one stream and a memory clobber on every streaming store.
An `sfence` separates the streaming stores from the temporal tail.
The self-hosted Debug backend substitutes temporal stores.
Masked memset requires LLVM and AVX-512BW.
The scalar ladder handles masked stores near page boundaries and all non-LLVM builds.

The numeric thresholds, vector width, alias masks, inline limit, and masked-set switch have build options.
`tuning.zig` contains the model table.
The thresholds describe the fleet instance sizes, not every host with those CPU models.
H5 move masking and H11 high-register variants remain deferred until fleet measurements justify them.

## Local evidence, 2026-09-24

No local result establishes performance parity or hardware correctness on the x86 fleet.
The local host is aarch64.

| Validation | Result |
|---|---|
| Native `zig build test`, Debug | 30 tests passed |
| Native `zig build test -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` | 30 tests passed |
| Native `zig build test -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe` | 30 tests passed |
| ReleaseFast install builds | All seven `bench.toml` rows and x86_64_v3 passed |
| Guard binary cross builds | All four x86 models passed in Debug, ReleaseFast, and ReleaseSafe |
| QEMU x86_64_v3 unit tests | 27 tests passed in each of Debug, ReleaseFast, and ReleaseSafe |
| QEMU x86_64_v3 ReleaseFast guard suite | 28,047,836 cases passed, maximum size 1 MiB |
| QEMU forced REP/NT unit tests | 27 tests passed |
| QEMU forced REP/NT guard suite | 28,047,836 cases passed, maximum size 1 MiB |
| QEMU Sapphire Rapids | SIGILL with `qemu-x86_64 -cpu max` |
| `ziglint src/x86_64/` | Passed |
| `ziglint src/` | Only pre-existing warnings outside this lane |

The forced-path runs used x86_64_v3 with these overrides:

```text
-Dx86-rep-movsb-min=512 -Dx86-rep-stosb-min=512
-Dx86-nt-min=4096 -Dx86-memset-nt-min=4096
```

These overrides test the shared REP and NT logic through AVX2.
They do not test AVX-512 memory operations or masked memset.
The initial Debug run exposed incorrect tiny-vector stores from the self-hosted backend.
The final implementation uses scalar stores for the 2-, 4-, and 8-byte memset classes.

`zig build codegen-x86` disassembles explicit CPU builds with consumer builtins enabled.
The gate follows each kernel size dispatch with concrete lengths.
It also checks the fixed-size consumers and the actual ABI entries.

| Model | Kernel classes | Fixed cases | Width | ABI | Memory symbols |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---:|
| sapphirerapids | 64 through 512 | 768 | ZMM, no YMM split | one direct branch | 0 |
| graniterapids | 64 through 512 | 768 | ZMM, no YMM split | one direct branch | 0 |
| znver4 | 64 through 512 | 768 | ZMM, no YMM split | one direct branch | 0 |
| znver5 | 64 through 512 | 768 | ZMM, no YMM split | one direct branch | 0 |
| x86_64_v3 | 32 through 256 | 384 | YMM, no ZMM | one direct branch | 0 |

Each AVX-512 fixed matrix covers copy, move, and set at every size from 1 through 256.
The v3 fixed matrix stops at its 128-byte inline limit.
Every tested vector return contains `vzeroupper`.
The gate checks masked stores, Intel REP paths, NT stores, and fences.
AMD and v3 contain no REP paths by default.

The aarch64 instruction bytes from `asm-all` match the pre-kernel build on Linux GNU, Linux musl, and macOS.
Only anonymous symbol numbers differ on macOS.
The three Neoverse models also produce identical `.text` sections before and after the change.
Their SHA-256 is `299bf8c0c43cae5fc336764e1440646d17c67ff020a95d82cc8d1fbb2dbb67f4`.
No file under `src/aarch64/` changed.

## Fleet procedure

1. Merge this lane into the parent checkout.
2. Extend the large suite to at least 256 MiB for the Granite Rapids NT path.
3. Run the hardware correctness matrix without `--up`.

```sh
nix develop /Users/matt/code/fastmem-zig -c just --justfile /Users/matt/code/fastmem-zig/Justfile b test --target c7i --target c8i --target c7a --target c8a
```

4. Run the standard suite with five rounds and the default A/A floor.

```sh
nix develop /Users/matt/code/fastmem-zig -c just --justfile /Users/matt/code/fastmem-zig/Justfile bench-run --rev WORKTREE --target c7i --target c8i --target c7a --target c8a --suite standard --rounds 5 --label p3-x86-standard
```

5. Run the large suite for the REP windows and NT paths.

```sh
nix develop /Users/matt/code/fastmem-zig -c just --justfile /Users/matt/code/fastmem-zig/Justfile bench-run --rev WORKTREE --target c7i --target c8i --target c7a --target c8a --suite large --rounds 5 --label p3-x86-large
```

6. Run the forward-gap cases separately for the Intel overlap regression.

```sh
nix develop /Users/matt/code/fastmem-zig -c just --justfile /Users/matt/code/fastmem-zig/Justfile bench-run --rev WORKTREE --target c7i --target c8i --target c7a --target c8a --suite standard --filter move/fwd-gap --rounds 5 --label p3-x86-fwd-gap
```

## Remaining limits

The current large suite stops at 64 MiB.
It reaches AMD and Sapphire Rapids NT paths, but not Granite Rapids NT paths.
The guard binary instead reaches 302 MiB on Granite Rapids.
Exact threshold timing requires additional threshold-minus-one, threshold, and threshold-plus-one cases.

`bench test` covers target and baseline CPUs in ReleaseFast.
Hardware Debug and ReleaseSafe runs remain separate checks.
`bench run --cpu baseline` measures G6 with the dispatched kernels.
All performance gates and the AVX-512 hardware tests remain open.
